# Mobile Healthcare Robot – SolidWorks & FEA

## Project Overview
Group design project focused on the mechanical design and structural validation
of a mobile healthcare robot.

I was responsible for:
- 3D CAD modelling in SolidWorks
- Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
- Structural stiffness and load assessment

## Engineering Approach
- Converted a hand-drawn concept into a fully parametric SolidWorks model
- Applied realistic boundary conditions and loading scenarios
- Evaluated stress distribution and deformation to assess structural integrity

## Key Outcomes
- Verified structural stiffness under expected service loads
- Improved manufacturability through parametric modelling
- Strengthened collaborative design and analytical problem-solving skills

## Tools Used
- SolidWorks
- Finite Element Analysis (FEA)


## CAD Model
